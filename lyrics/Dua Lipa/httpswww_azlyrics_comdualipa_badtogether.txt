Dua Lipa - Bad Together Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
(Baby, you're okay)
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
(Baby, I'm okay)
Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Nothing can stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
'Cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm better than I've ever been
Baby, when, when you're far away
I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe, let's be bad
Let's be bad, babe
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
