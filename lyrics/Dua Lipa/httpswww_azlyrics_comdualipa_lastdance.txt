Dua Lipa - Last Dance Lyrics | AZLyrics.com

Fatal, this attraction,
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali
When I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel—feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
My eyes wide open,
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me
And it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel—feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
I'll fall in love
