Critically, this version of Tweepy is *not* on the upgrade path from Version 3, so you will not be able to simply upgrade the package if you are on Version 3. Instead you will need to explicitly install version 4, which you can do with a command like this: `pip install \"tweepy>=4\"`. You will also be using Version 2 of the Twitter API for this assignment. \n",

    "Run the below cell. If your version of Tweepy begins with a \"4\", then you should be good to go. If it begins with a \"3\" then run the following command, found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5226311/installing-specific-package-version-with-pip), at the command line or in a cell: `pip install -Iv tweepy==4.9`.
